# Django-LiveProject
## Introduction
For two weeks during my time at The Tech Academy, I worked along side my peers as a team to create a website for hobbies using Django. The team took part in daily stand-ups to prepare for our sprints. We used DevOps to stay on track and organized. I better understood version control and learned new front end and back end skills while working in a team. We each created webpages for a hobby we each chose. I created my webpages around Cult Classic Movies. The two weeks were broken down into stories that each individual did at their own pace. The stories starting out had to do with the front end and UX, while the later stories revolved around gathering user input and backend database work as well as integrating an API to my portion of the site.
## Overview
The First few stories were just to get a basic look for the pages and to get them linked to the main page.

Created a base.html containing my navbar and footer that was used for all other pages.

Next was to create models and view functions that will be called upon to gather input from a user and store that in a database. I wanted mine to be setup where the user enters in their recipes into a form where it will be saved and could be called upon later to edit or delete.
